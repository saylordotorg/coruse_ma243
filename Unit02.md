**Unit 2: Complex Functions** <span id="2"></span> 
*In this unit, we will learn about functions that depend on a single
complex variable that have values in the complex plane.  We will begin
by discussing complex differentiability, which will enable us to
introduce the definition of a holomorphic function.  A holomorphic
function can be defined as a function differentiable in an open set, or
as a function that is differentiable with a continuous derivative in an
open set.  These two possible definitions are equivalent according to
Goursat’s Theorem.   
           
 On the other hand, when interpreting a complex function as a function
of two real variables (the real and imaginary parts of the complex
argument), the separation of the function values into their real and
imaginary parts will produce two real-valued functions each depending on
two real variables.  The Cauchy Riemann equations will provide us with
the conditions that those two functions must satisfy in order for the
original complex function to be holomorphic.  
            
 We will conclude this unit by discussing Laplace’s equation and
harmonic functions, topics important both in Complex Analysis and in
Partial Differential Equations.*

     Note that Professor Chen defines “analytic” to mean
    complex-differentiable functions, while Professor Beck et al. use
    “holomorphic” instead.  In fact, “holomorphic” is the more
    technically correct word; “analytic” more generally refers to
    functions which can be represented as power series.  However, a key
    result of Complex Analysis (which will be proven later) is that a
    function of a complex variable is holomorphic (on a domain) if and
    only if it is analytic (on that domain).
