**Unit 3: Power Series** <span id="3"></span> 
*A power series with complex coefficients can be considered a
generalization of a polynomial function. Since the terms are
polynomials, they are also analytic functions. Therefore, it seems
reasonable to expect that the sum of the series will be an analytic
function.  In this unit, we will study the basic properties of power
series in order to prepare us to use them to represent analytic
functions in Unit 6.  
  
 If you are already familiar with the material in this unit, i.e.
through MA241, then feel free to move on to Unit 4.  See learning
outcomes below.*

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Define convergent and Cauchy sequences.
-   State and use the Monotone Sequence Property.
-   State the Archimedean Property.
-   Define convergence of series and state some properties necessary for
    the convergence of a series.
-   Define absolute convergence.
-   Define and use the integral test.
-   Define uniform convergence of a sequence of functions.
-   State a sufficient condition for the limit of a sequence of
    functions on a domain to be continuous on that domain.
-   State several sufficient conditions for the convergence of the
    integrals of a sequence of functions.
-   Define power series and define region and radius of convergence.
-   State the region of convergence for the geometric series and use it
    to solve problems involving convergence of power series.
-   Use the power series expansion for e<sup>z</sup> to calculate the
    power series expansion of the trigonometric functions.
