**Unit 4: Examples of Complex Functions** <span id="4"></span> 
*Now that we have reviewed power series, we will use them to define the
exponential function and the functions cosine and sine in the complex
domain.  We will see how these functions are related.  In order to
define an inverse for the exponential function, we will need to use the
complex logarithm.  Pay close attention to the construction of the
different branches of the logarithm.  
  
 We will also study Möbius Transformations, a type of a linear
fractional transformation (the quotient of two polynomials of degree one
or constant), learning about some of their geometric properties,
including how they transform the Projective Plane. *

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Define linear fractional and Möbius transformations.

    transformations.
-   Define the cross ratio.
-   Define what it means for a function of a complex variable to map a
    point to infinity.

    hyperbolic functions given the definition of the complex
    exponential.

     The process of constructing the logarithm is tricky because, simply
    put, it requires us to find a good definition of the “argument” of a
    complex number.  However, as we know, if z=re<sup>i?</sup>, then
    z=re<sup>i(?+2πk)</sup> for any integer value of k. Here, ? is the
    argument of z, and for any z it is cannot be uniquely determined
    unless we choose a range to which argument will be restricted. This
    situation will lead us to define the different branches of the
    logarithm, and will necessitate careful bookkeeping of arguments
    whenever the logarithm is encountered, most especially in Unit 7
    when we begin to calculate residues.
