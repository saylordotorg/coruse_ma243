This course is an introduction to complex analysis, or the theory of the
analytic functions of a complex variable.  Put differently, complex
analysis is the theory of the differentiation and integration of
functions that depend on one complex variable.  Such functions,
beautiful on their own, are immediately useful in Physics, Engineering,
and Signal Processing.  Because of the algebraic properties of the
complex numbers and the inherently geometric flavor of complex analysis,
this course will feel quite different from Real Analysis, although many
of the same concepts, such as open sets, metrics, and limits will
reappear.  Simply put, you will be working with lines and sets and very
specific functions on the complex plane—drawing pictures of them and
teasing out all of their idiosyncrasies.  You will again find yourself
calculating line integrals, just as in multivariable calculus.  However,
the techniques you learn in this course will help you get past many of
the seeming dead-ends you ran up against in calculus.  Indeed, most of
the definite integrals you will learn to evaluate in Unit 7 come
directly from problems in physics and cannot be solved except through
techniques from complex variables. We will begin by studying the minimal
algebraically closed extension of real numbers: the complex numbers. 
The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that any non-constant
polynomial with complex coefficients has a zero in the complex numbers. 
This makes life in the complex plane very interesting.  We will also
review a bit of the geometry of the complex plane and relevant
topological concepts, such as connectedness. In Unit 2, we will study
differential calculus in the complex domain.  The concept of analytic or
holomorphic function will be introduced as complex differentiability in
an open subset of the complex numbers.  The Cauchy-Riemann equations
will establish a connection between analytic functions and
differentiable functions depending on two real variables.  In Unit 3, we
will review power series, which will be the link between holomorphic and
analytic functions.  In Unit 4, we will introduce certain special
functions, including exponentials and trigonometric and logarithmic
functions. We will consider the Möbius Transformation in some detail. In
Units 5, 6, and 7 we will study Cauchy Theory, as well as its most
important applications, including the Residue Theorem.  We will compute
Laurent series, and we will use the Residue Theorem to evaluate certain
integrals on the real line which cannot be dealt with through methods
from real variables alone.  Our final unit, Unit 8, will discuss
harmonic functions of two real variables, which are functions with
continuous second partial derivatives that satisfy the Laplace equation,
conformal mappings, and the Open Mapping Theorem.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able
to:  

-   Fundamentals: Manipulate complex numbers in various representations,
    define fundamental topological concepts in the context of the
    complex plane, and define and calculate limits and derivatives of
    functions of a complex variable.
-   Key Functions: Represent analytic functions as power series on their
    domains and verify that they are well-defined.  Define a branch of
    the complex logarithm.  Classify singularities and find Laurent
    series for meromorphic functions.
-   Key Results: State and prove fundamental results, including:
    Cauchy’s Theorem and Cauchy’s Integral Formula, the Fundamental
    Theorem of Algebra, Morera’s Theorem and Liouville’s Theorem.  Use
    them to prove related results.
-   Key Application: Calculate contour integrals.  Calculate definite
    integrals on the real line using the Residue Theorem.
-   Mappings: Define linear fractional transformations and prove their
    essential characteristics.  Find the image of a region under a
    conformal mapping.  State, prove, and use the Open Mapping Theorem.
