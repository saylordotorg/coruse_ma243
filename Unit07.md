**Unit 7: Residue Theory** <span id="7"></span> 
*The unit opens with the Residue Theorem, one of the most useful results
in complex analysis, which allows one to calculate many integrals which
the usual techniques of real variables do not allow us to evaluate.
 Recall that the “residue” of the function at the singularity will be
defined by one of the coefficients of the Laurent expansion around the
singularity.              
  
 We will then introduce the Argument Principle and Rouche’s Theorem,
which pertain to meromorphic functions.  We will close the unit by using
these results to evaluate a number of different types of definite
integrals on the real line which can only be handled using techniques
from Complex Analysis.*
