**Unit 1: Complex Numbers** <span id="1"></span> 
*The set of real numbers is a field that is not algebraically closed. 
In other words, some polynomials with real coefficients do not have a
root in the real numbers (e.g., x<sup>2</sup>+1=0 has no solution in the
real numbers).  In order to extend the set of real numbers to a larger
field that is algebraically closed, we will consider the plane equipped
with an addition rule and a multiplication rule that extends the
corresponding operations in the real numbers.  This new field is known
as “the complex numbers.”  In the complex numbers, there is a number
whose square is equal to negative one: the “imaginary number” i.  
  
 In this unit, we will study the algebraic and geometric properties of
the complex numbers.  Complex numbers are akin to 2D vectors, and
therefore addition and multiplication of complex numbers have a very
nice geometric interpretation.  We will also consider some basic
topology of the complex plane: open sets, paths, etc.  In order to
discuss functions that become infinite as the variable approaches a
given point, we will introduce the extended complex plane and its
representation as the unit sphere in the three dimensional real space by
means of the stereographic projection.*
