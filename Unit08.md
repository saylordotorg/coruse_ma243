**Unit 8: Harmonic Functions and Conformal Mappings** <span
id="8"></span> 
*In Unit 2, we talked about the Cauchy Riemann equations.  Because of
these equations, we noticed that the real and imaginary parts of an
analytic function satisfy the Laplace equation.  In other words, we
learned that these parts are harmonic functions.  In this last unit, we
will study some of the basic properties of harmonic functions,
especially the Mean and Minimum Value Properties.  
              
 We will revisit transformations (especially the Möbius transformation)
and discuss conformal mappings--mappings which preserve angles between
arcs.  We will also explore two of the most important results in Complex
Analysis: the Open Mapping Theorem and the Riemann Mapping Theorem.*

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you 12 hours to complete
